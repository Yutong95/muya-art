      <p class="chinese">"Retro is a kind of mark, constantly reappearing, but forgets the essence of retro: discontent with reality.The future recast from the past and the present. Restoring ancient ways, remolding from the old times and the new century.Break the old ways with the old ways.To discover, to deny, to reconstruct.The accumulation of history is profound in restoring ancient ways, and the creation of the future is bursting out in restoring ancient ways.So that's SOARIN."▷▷▷▷</p></a>

       <p class="chinese">Jason. S. Wright<br>
      Born 1987, US. Lives and works in Richmond, VA, US. Jason S. Wright’s work is an exploration of the parallels found within the creative practice and spiritual practice. A symbiotic bond that is constantly leading to new discoveries as he searches through media, material, and the psyche. Deeply rooted in the underground traditions of self-publishing and bootleg ideology where it is more fruitful to create your own world rather than assimilating to someone else’s, Wright mines his personal journey for ideas and narratives that become the building blocks for a path he takes one step at a time, one day at a time. ▷▷▷▷</p></a>
